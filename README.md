The code to get unique faces for the training and testing sets can be found in **training.m** and **test_images.m** respectively.
**main.m** contains the code for making the facespace and assessing the differences in distance measurement matrices.
**figure_code.m** contains the code for producing the mean face, eigenfaces, etc.
**experiment_code.m** was run for the four psychophysical tasks, varying the distance measurement parameter.
